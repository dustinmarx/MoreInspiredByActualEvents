Software Development Resources "Inspired by Actual Events"

This is a collection of software development articles and resources that complement the blog posts on the "*Inspired by Actual Events*" blog (https://marxsoftware.blogspot.com). The "*Inspired by Actual Events*" blog posts are typically written once and not updated (except to fix typos, spelling amd gramatical errors, etc.) and cannot be changed by other contributors. The resources in this GitHUb repository, on the other hand, are more likely to be updated than blog posts and may benefit from contributions of others via approved pull requests.
