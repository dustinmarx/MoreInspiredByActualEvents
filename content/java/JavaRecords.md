## Quotations on Java Records ##

This page provides some quotations on Java Records that are useful in understanding how [Records](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/records-come-to-java) are designed and how to most effectively apply them. These quotations are _not_ currently organized or categorized, but that _may_ change in future versions of this document.

* "Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes which are transparent holders for shallowly immutable data." - [JEP 359: Records (Preview)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/359)
* Records "are classes that act as transparent carriers for immutable data" and "can be thought of as _nominal tuples_." - [JEP 384: Records (Second Preview) (as of 9 May 2020)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)
* "While it is superficially tempting to treat records as primarily being about boilerplate reduction, we instead choose a more semantic goal: _modeling data as data_. (If the semantics are right, the boilerplate will take care of itself.) ... records make the semantic claim of being transparent carriers for their data." - [JEP 384: Records (Second Preview) (as of 9 May 2020)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)
* "_Records_ are a new kind of class in the Java language. The purpose of a record is to declare that a small group of variables is to be regarded as a new kind of entity. A record declares its state -- the group of variables -- and commits to an API that matches that state. This means that records give up a freedom that classes usually enjoy -- the ability to decouple a class's API from its internal representation -- but in return, records become significantly more concise." - [JEP 384: Records (Second Preview) (as of 9 May 2020)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)
* "Records can be considered a nominal form of _tuples_." - [JEP 384: Records (Second Preview) (as of 9 May 2020)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)
* "For all these reasons, we don't want to abandon classes for modeling data; we just want to make modeling data with classes simpler. The major pain of using named classes for aggregates is the overhead of declaring them; if we can reduce this sufficiently, the temptation to reach for more weakly typed mechanisms is greatly reduced. (A good starting point for thinking about records is that they are _nominal tuples_.)" - [Brian Goetz, Data Classes and Sealed Types for Java, February 2019](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/datum.html)
* "The major road-not-taken was trying to extend records to replace _mutable JavaBean classes_." - [Brian Goetz, Java 14 Feature Spotlight: Records, 4 February 2020](https://www.infoq.com/articles/java-14-feature-spotlight/)
* "So, while it is superficially tempting to think about records as primarily being about boilerplate reduction, we preferred to approach it as a semantic problem; how can we better model data aggregates directly in the language, and provide a sound semantic basis for such classes that developers can easily reason about? (The approach of treating this as a semantic, rather than syntatic, problem worked quite well for enums.) And the logical answer for Java was: records are nominal tuples." - [Brian Goetz, Java 14 Feature Spotlight: Records, 4 February 2020](https://www.infoq.com/articles/java-14-feature-spotlight/)
* "Common goal" of records: "records are the state, the whole state, and nothing but the state. Specifically, we want _equality_ of records to be derived from the entirety of the state declared in the state description, and nothing else." - [Brian Goetz, Java 14 Feature Spotlight: Records, 4 February 2020](https://www.infoq.com/articles/java-14-feature-spotlight/)
* "Given that the design center for records is nominal tuples, one might ask why we didn't choose structural tuples instead. Here, the answer is simple: _names matter_." - [Brian Goetz, Java 14 Feature Spotlight: Records, 4 February 2020](https://www.infoq.com/articles/java-14-feature-spotlight/)
* "But that's (Billy Boilerplate vision for records) not what records are.  Records are _nominal tuples_; they _are_ their data.  It is
entirely appropriate for the data definition to be front and center in the declaration -- because that's what records are." - [Brian Goetz, 15 April 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-April/005842.html)
* "You are viewing records as largely a syntactic convenience, but that's not what they are.  Records are a _semantic_ feature; they are
the state, the whole state, and nothing but the state.  All their protocols -- construction, deconstruction, equality, hashing, string representation -- are derived mechanically from a common state description." - [Brian Goetz, 15 April 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-April/005842.html)
* "The reality is: if you're looking for a tool to automate the generation of JavaBean-style classes for your APIs, this [Java Record] isn't it. In fact, most  APIs probably won't expose very many; we're far more likely to use them internally as implementation details.  And they're great for that!" - [Brian Goetz, 15 April 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-April/005842.html)
* "But records are not a syntactic feature, they are a semantic one, whose syntactic benefits are a happy consequence of the carefully
chosen semantics." - [Brian Goetz, 3 May 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-May/005945.html)
* "Looking at records through the lens of 'how many of my classes can I convert', while tempting, is not necessarily the right way to judge the feature.  Instead, perhaps we should ask ourselves: 'if I had records when I wrote this, could I have used them profitably?'" - [Brian Goetz, 7 May 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-May/005972.html)
* "A record is a nominal tuple" - [Brian Goetz, 7 May 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-May/005972.html)
* "The purpose of having a new declaration form is so that the author can communicate their design intent.  When you say 'record', you are making it crystal clear what you want -- that you intend that this class is a transparent, shallowly immutable carrier for a specified tuple of data." - [Brian Goetz, 11 October 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2019-October/004889.html)
* "Multiple return is a weak feature, that will feel like tuples dangled in front of your face, and then snatched back; We prefer nominal tuple (records) to structural ones." - [Brian Goetz, 14 January 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2019-January/000969.html)
* "Records are clearly not beans, they are effectively something new (nominal tuples) that Java devs will have to learn not to overuse." - [Stephen Colebourne, 15 December 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2019-December/005379.html)
* "We should communicate more on that, records are not beans, i repeat, records are not beans ! you will be disappointed if you try to replace all your beans by records." - [RÃ©mi Forax, 15 December 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2019-December/005381.html)
* "You are trying to use records for something they were not intended for.  The design center for records is (as has been stated many times) "nominal tuples".  Is `nvmlInit` effectively a tuple?  Are the state-based equals, hashCode, and toString methods a natural fit for the domain?  Is the canonical constructor enforcing any necessary invariants?  Are you getting any benefit _at all_ from declaring as a record?  I don't think so.  These are signs that this isn't the tool you are looking for. ... Or, perhaps you might consider whether records are helpful as the _implementation detail_ of your class, by wrapping a record with the API you actually want to expose?" - [Brian Goetz, 9 March 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-March/005682.html)
* "Yes, the naming discussion has been had, and yes, tuple was considered. The consensus was that calling it 'tuple' would engender a 'but that's not what a tuple is' response from those who are used to tuples being structural, not nominal, and that this would be a distraction.  So we chose a name that was a little less loaded, but was still associated with nominal, fixed-sized-and-type sequences (think records in a relational database.)  Coincidentally, the C# folks went through the same process and independently came up with the name '[record](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/records.md)'." - [Brian Goetz, 10 March 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-March/005685.html)
* "In the end, JavaBean Jerry was not the winner; Tuples Tommy was.  And this choice of design center affects nearly every aspect of the final feature design. The outcome is that *records are nominal tuples*, so we would expect them to work best where we might use tuples (data carriers across boundaries, compound map keys, etc), and not as well where we use beans." - [Brian Goetz, 22 November 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2019-November/005272.html)
  * As of this writing, the [February 2019 edition of "Data Classes and Sealed Types for Java"](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/datum.html) describes the "developers" who all see "data classes" differently: Algebraic Annie, Boilerplate Billy and brother JavaBean Jerry, Tuple Tommy, and Values Victor.
* "If instead we say 'records are just nominal tuples', two good things happen: - Those who vaguely know what tuples are will get it; - Those who wish we had done structural tuples will have nothing to argue with." - [Brian Goetz, 12 April 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2019-April/001135.html)
* "Records have semantics, which makes them *worlds* different from tuples. Methods, supertypes, validation, specification... I think it's fair to say that all a record *holds* is a "tuple", but it's so much more. Record is to tuple as enum is to int." - [Kevin Bourrillion, 12 April 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2019-April/001139.html)
* "And also note that Java `record` is to C `struct` as Java `enum` is to C `enum`." - [Guy Steele, 12 April 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2019-April/001141.html)
* "Records are _transparent, shallowly immutable containers for their state_.  But that's [macro generator] not what records are -- records are _nominal tuples_ (just as functional interfaces are _nominal function types_.)" - [Brian Goetz, 14 December 2019](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2019-December/005377.html)
* [Morling](https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1250526472231686144): "Record components shall not be named notify (or wait, or clone, or...)." [Goetz](https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/status/1250882629316075525): "These component names flow into API members.  Some are actual clashes (e.g., a component named `toString` with type `int`), but we erred on the side of banning all names of members from `Object`.  (Yes, we know that `wait` isn't really a conflict.)" - [Gunnar Morling and Brian Goetz, 15 April 2020](https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz/status/1250882629316075525)
* "Records are the data, the whole data, and nothing but the data." - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "If your alternate constructors are not merely expanding to a representation, and the canonical constructor is not flowing values from the arguments to the fields (perhaps routed through validation and/or normalization), you're probably not in the semantic territory to be a record anyway." - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "The canonical constructor arguments _are_ the (candidate) field values." - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "Records give you a clean way to declare the canonical constructor (the compact constructor), to minimize the overhead of centralizing invariant checking, to maximize chance that developers will actually check invariants." - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "In the compact constructor, you just mutate the parameters if you want to normalize them (after validation, if any.)  The resulting parameter values are automatically committed to the fields at the end of the constructor." - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "Most of the reasons that make factories better than constructors don't apply to records, because records are already quite restricted." - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "The compact constructor effects a (usually trivial) transform on the record state, _and then_ stamps that into a new record." - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "You are getting caught up on: 'but I must initialize the fields via assignment.'  Let go of that, and the answer becomes obvious, and your code gets better" - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "But if you stop thinking of records as 'more concise classes', and instead as 'nominal tuple objects', this gets a lot easier -- and you'll probably like it." - [Brian Goetz, 9 June 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-June/006197.html)
* "Record classes are a special kind of class that are used primarily to define a simple aggregate of values." - [Gavin Bierman, 27 July 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-July/002254.html)
* "Records can be thought of as _nominal tuples_; their declaration commits to a description of their state and given that their representation, as well as all
of the interesting protocols an object might expose -- construction, property access, equality, etc -- are derived from that state description." - [Gavin Bierman, 27 July 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-July/002254.html)
* "The body of a record class declaration is often empty, but it can contain method declarations as usual. Indeed, if it is necessary, the implicitly declared members - the accessors, canonical constructor, and equals, toString, or HashCode methods -- can alternatively be explicitly declared in the body." - [Gavin Bierman, 27 July 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-July/002254.html)
* "Often the reason for explicitly providing a canonical constructor for a record class is to validate and/or normalize the argument values." - [Gavin Bierman, 27 July 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-July/002254.html)
* "If the canonical constructor is implicitly declared then its access modifier is the same as the record class. If it is explicitly declared then its access modifier must provide at least as much access as the record class." - [Gavin Bierman, 27 July 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-July/002254.html)
* "The records JEP also allows for local record declarations. This is important as records will often be used as containers for intermediate data within method bodies. Being able to declare these record classes locally is essential to stop proliferation of classes." - [Gavin Bierman, 27 July 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-July/002254.html)
* "Records ... are implicitly static." - [Brian Goetz, 3 August 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-August/002266.html)
* "In records, we made the deliberate choice to design the feature for new code than for catering to the quirks of existing code." - [Brian Goetz, 5 August 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-August/006414.html)
* "The model for records (immutable, transparent carriers for a fixed state vector) is different ... from mutable JavaBeans..." - [Brian Goetz, 5 August 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-August/006414.html)
* "**Records are not JavaBeans**. The JavaBeans spec requires that a bean has a public no-args constructor. After creating the object, it's state is then set using the various setters. Records on the other hand are immutable - their contents need to be known at creation." - [Johannes Kuhn, 5 August 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-August/006415.html)
* "Records are not just immutable POJOs with generated members; there is a semantic guarantee (which of course people can break if they are careless)..." - [Brian Goetz, 15 August 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-August/006487.html)
* "The important thing to understand about records (and, we apparently cannot say this enough times) is that they are _not really about syntactic concision_; syntactic concision is merely a pleasing side-effect of something more important, which is that a record is expected to have certain semantics (which, of course, uncooperative authors or code mangling tools can undermine.)  Records introduce into the language the first glimmer of a notion of accessor; the method `x()` in record `Foo(int x)` is not just a method, it is an accessor, and reflection tells you so.  This is far more reliable than a mere naming convention!" - [Brian Goetz, 27 August 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-August/006523.html)
* "It is reasonable for a client who observes `clazz.isRecord()` to expect that fetching the accessors, and then fetching their values, just always works, because records are a semantic feature." - [Brian Goetz, 27 August 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-August/006523.html)
* "Records are just classes." - [Brian Goetz, 22 September 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-September/006654.html)
* "Explicit specification of serialVersionUID in records rarely makes sense and should be discouraged." - [Tagir Valeev, 3 August 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-August/006407.html)
* "A Record does not support encapsulation (separating the public API and the private implementation) given that it's a named tuple. If you want encapsulation, use a class." - [RÃ©mi Forax, 1 October 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2020-October/002572.html)
* "Records are the Java version of named tuples - basically containers for an ordered sequence of elements." - [Johan Janssen, 12 August 2020](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/08/java16-records-instanceof/)
* "Records are named tuples, they are defined only by their components, in a transparent manner i.e. no encapsulation." - [RÃ©mi Forax, 23 December 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-December/006871.html)
* "The idea is that, in a method, if you are able to see a record, you can create it. Thus the canonical constructor has the same visibility as the record itself." - [RÃ©mi Forax, 23 December 2020](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2020-December/006871.html)
* "Records are not a âmacro generatorâ; to think of records in terms of "the compiler generates XYZ pattern of code", while technically accurate, is missing the main point.  They are a semantic feature, that happens to dispense with some boilerplate." - [Brian Goetz, 22 May 2021](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2021-May/077957.html)
* "Records are best understood as _nominal tuples_; they are the languageâs mechanism for representing product types.  Because Java is an OO language, we can mediate the construction process to reject invalid states or normalize state to its canonical form, and we derive the semantics for accessors, equals, hashCode, etc, from the semantics of tuples." - [Brian Goetz, 22 May 2021](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2021-May/077957.html)
* "... a record is a weird tuple. A record in Java is not just a tuple, ... but because all components are named also a compact key/value set." - [RÃ©mi Forax, 14 September 2021](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2021-September/003104.html)
* Records do [not support C-style array declarations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69056728/c-style-arrays-do-not-work-with-records-anymore) because "the C-style array notation is considered legacy and is not being carried forward into new constructs." - [Brian Goetz, 5 September 2021](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69056728/c-style-arrays-do-not-work-with-records-anymore#comment122063101_69056729)
* "The boilerplate-reduction benefits of records is a bonus, but was not the point.  Records are about the language having a direct way to describe *data as data*. This is a semantic upleveling, not a mere boilerplate-reduction.  The boilerplate reduction *derives from* the semantic upleveling." - [Brian Goetz, 20 May 2022](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/amber-dev/2022-May/007358.html)
